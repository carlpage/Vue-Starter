# VueJS Starter Config

VueJS Starter Config

I built a VueJS starter configuration that no one will likely every use since vue cli does all of this for you. I built this to gain a deeper understanding of Webpack.

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run a dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

## Running

```sh
node dist/bundle.js
```
